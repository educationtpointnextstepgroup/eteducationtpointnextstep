I used some photos from unsplash and some videos from youtube. This is for learning purpose only. I don't hold any rights of these assets, except the code. :sweat_smile:

### Deployment
The project is deployed on [Heroku](https://educative-py.herokuapp.com/).

<small>I did a sily mistake here. I pushed the 'master' branch with some bugs need to be fixed. <br/>
  The 'auth' brach is deployed live.
